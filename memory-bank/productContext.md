# Product Context

## Purpose
DreamTales is a magical bedtime story companion that creates personalized, therapeutic tales for children ages 3-7. The AI-powered chat application helps children process emotions, learn valuable lessons, and wind down for sleep through engaging, age-appropriate stories.

## Problems Solved
1. **Bedtime Struggles**: Parents need engaging content to help children transition to sleep
2. **Emotional Processing**: Children need safe ways to explore feelings and situations
3. **Personalization Gap**: Generic stories don't connect with individual children's experiences
4. **Educational Opportunity**: Bedtime can be a teaching moment wrapped in entertainment
5. **Consistency Challenge**: Parents want reliable, quality storytelling when tired themselves

## How It Works
1. **Interactive Chat**: Children (with parent guidance) chat with the AI companion
2. **Personalized Stories**: AI creates unique tales based on child's input and interests
3. **Therapeutic Elements**: Stories gently address emotions, fears, and learning opportunities
4. **Session Continuity**: Each chat has a unique URL for easy return to conversations
5. **Customizable Prompts**: Parents/caregivers can adjust the AI's storytelling approach

## User Experience Goals
