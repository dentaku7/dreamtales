# Product Context

## Purpose
DreamTales exists to empower writers and creators to build interactive narratives that engage audiences through dynamic storytelling experiences. The platform bridges the gap between traditional writing and modern web interactivity.

## Problems Solved
1. Lack of accessible tools for creating interactive web-based stories
2. Difficulty in sharing and collaborating on narrative projects
3. Limited engagement options for readers beyond passive consumption
4. Need for a centralized platform that combines writing tools with audience interaction

## How It Works
1. Writers create stories using a visual editor with branching path capabilities
2. Readers interact with stories through clickable choices that influence narrative outcomes
3. Collaborative features allow multiple authors to work on interconnected story elements
4. Social sharing enables stories to be embedded or linked across platforms

## User Experience Goals
- Writers should be able to create complex narrative structures without technical barriers
- Readers should experience seamless transitions between story paths
- Collaboration tools should feel intuitive and enhance creative synergy
- The platform should maintain performance even with complex, large-scale narratives
