# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Implementation of unique URL sharing for chat sessions

## Recent Changes
1. Fixed syntax error in App.js caused by misplaced closing brace in sendWelcomeMessage function
2. Verified server-side chat ID generation and routing in worker/index.js
3. Confirmed client-side chat ID handling and share button functionality

## Next Steps
1. Test chat sharing functionality end-to-end
2. Verify URL routing works for shared chat links
3. Ensure chat persistence across sessions

## Active Decisions
1. Using Cloudflare Worker's generateSessionId function for chat ID generation
2. Client-side routing via window.location for shared chat URLs
3. KV storage for chat history persistence with 7-day expiration

## Important Patterns
1. Chat ID is generated from client IP and user agent for session continuity
2. Worker handles both chat ID generation and history retrieval
3. Client displays share button only after chat ID is established

## Preferences
1. Maintain existing error handling patterns
2. Follow established API response format
3. Use existing styling for share button

## Learnings & Insights
1. The chat sharing feature was already implemented but had a frontend syntax error
2. Worker implementation already supports chat ID routing and persistence
3. Fixing the frontend syntax error enables the complete sharing workflow
