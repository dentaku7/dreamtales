# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Initial implementation of core storytelling features and authentication system

## Recent Changes
1. Memory bank initialization started with core documentation files
2. Project structure confirmed with client/server/worker architecture
3. Technology stack validated (React, Tailwind, Cloudflare Workers)

## Next Steps
1. Implement user authentication endpoints
2. Create story data models and storage mechanisms
3. Develop basic story creation interface

## Active Decisions
1. JSON vs SQLite for story storage (currently using JSON for simplicity)
2. JWT vs session-based authentication (leaning towards JWT for stateless approach)
3. Client-side routing strategy (React Router with protected routes implementation)

## Important Patterns
1. API request handling with loading/error states
2. Form validation patterns for story creation
3. Component communication through context/state management

## Preferences
1. Favor component composition over complex state management
2. Prioritize accessibility in UI implementation
3. Use TypeScript for new components (existing code is JavaScript)

## Learnings & Insights
1. Project structure aligns with Cloudflare deployment requirements
2. Current tooling supports rapid development of interactive features
3. Need to establish clear data contracts between client and server
