# Progress

## What Works
1. **Core Chat System**: Full bedtime story chat functionality with OpenAI integration
2. **Routing**: React Router with a single `/chat` route
3. **Master Prompt Management**: Configurable prompts via UI or environment variables
4. **Development Environment**: Client and server running concurrently with hot reload
5. **Chat Persistence**: Single KV key for chat history with 7-day expiration
6. **Responsive UI**: Tailwind CSS implementation with glass morphism effects
7. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and user feedback
8. **Rate Limiting**: 20 requests/minute protection via Cloudflare Workers
9. **Auto-routing**: Base URL redirects to `/chat`
10. **Environment Configuration**: Easy local setup with .env file

## What's Left to Build
1. User authentication system (optional enhancement)
2. Story personalization features (child's name, preferences)
3. Story history and favorites
4. Parent dashboard for monitoring interactions
5. Enhanced UI animations and interactions

## Current Status
**Fully functional bedtime story chat application**. Core chat system works end-to-end with proper URL routing, master prompt management, and persistence. Ready for production deployment on Cloudflare. All major technical challenges resolved.

## Known Issues
None - all critical functionality working properly.

## Evolution of Decisions
1. **From Story Platform to Chat App**: Pivoted from interactive story editor to AI chat companion
2. **URL Routing Refactor**: Replaced broken sharing system with proper React Router implementation  
3. **Master Prompt Strategy**: KV storage in production, environment variables for development
4. **Component Architecture**: Split into ChatWrapper/Chat for better routing management
5. **Development Setup**: Streamlined with concurrently running client and server
6. **Error Prevention**: Fixed infinite loops and dependency issues proactively
