# Progress

## What Works
1. Memory bank initialization completed with core documentation files
2. Project structure validated (client/server/worker architecture confirmed)
3. Technology stack setup (React, Tailwind CSS, Cloudflare Workers)
4. Development environment configured (Node.js 18, npm, Vite)
5. Unique URL sharing for chat sessions implemented and working
6. Chat persistence via KV storage with 7-day expiration
7. Share button functionality with clipboard copying

## What's Left to Build
1. User authentication system (login/registration endpoints)
2. Story creation and editing interface
3. Interactive story viewing experience
4. Collaboration and social sharing features
5. Deployment configuration for Cloudflare

## Current Status
Project setup complete, memory bank initialized, and core documentation established. Development environment verified functional with current tooling. Chat sharing functionality implemented and working. Next steps focus on implementing authentication endpoints and story data models.

## Known Issues
1. No persistent storage implementation yet (currently using JSON files)
2. Authentication strategy not fully implemented (planning JWT approach)
3. Story creation interface design in early planning phase

## Evolution of Decisions
1. Initial focus on documentation and setup before coding
2. Decision to use JWT for stateless authentication aligns with serverless architecture
3. Prioritizing JSON storage for simplicity during initial development
4. Frontend-first approach for UI/UX validation before deep backend integration
5. Leveraged existing Cloudflare Worker functionality for chat ID generation and routing
